When documents have changed and I want to save them in git do this:
git status   (lists what is changed)
git add file1 (the first file that was changed)
git add file2 (the second file that was changed)
git status   (double check that all files are in checkin list)
git commit -m "Some comment about the changes"


When I want to save the git changes to github:
git push origin master
